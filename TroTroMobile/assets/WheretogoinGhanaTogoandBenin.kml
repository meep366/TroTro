    <name>Ada Foah, relaxing on the beach</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr"><img src="http://www.joli-ecotours.com/googlemaps/images/adafoah.jpg"><span>Beach hut in Ada Foah</span>Ada Foah is somewhat off the beaten track in coastal Ghana and a perfect place to relax from your journeys. Beach camps, such as Maranatha, offer hammocks under palm trees, with grilled barracuda and sole with chips and drinks. We recommend Dreamland Beach Resort, especially for travellers with children, and the cozy Esime Guesthouse in town.&nbsp;</div><div dir="ltr"><br>An idea is to cross the river from Ada to one of the many islands dotting the estuary or to visit the weekly Ananyui market by ferry-canoe.</div><p>Â© <a href="http://www.joli-ecotours.com" target="_blank">Jolinaiko Eco Tours</a>.

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr"><img src="http://www.joli-ecotours.com/googlemaps/images/digya.jpg"><span>Digya National Park</span>If you really like to go off the beaten track, arrange a trip to the northern part of Digya National Park with us. The wildlife rangers can take you on a hiking safari through the savannah woodlands combined with a canoe trip on the Sene River. <br><br>The rangersâ camp offers a great camping ground and Jolinaiko will provide the necessary equipment (tents and mattresses). The longer you stay the more chance you have to spot wildlife species such as antelopes, monkeys, warthogs and if you are really lucky, elephants. The serene nature, colorful river birds and friendly fishing communities are the main ingredients for a memorable camping adventure, preferably in dry season from November till April.</div>

    <name>Atsiekpoe and the Jolinaiko Cashew Village Lodge</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr"><img src="http://www.joli-ecotours.com/googlemaps/images/atsiekpoe.jpg"><span>The ferry canoe to Atsiekpoe</span>The village of Atsiekpoe is only a one and a half hour drive from Accra, after which you find yourself in a peaceful place surrounded by beautiful nature. To get to Atsiekpoe you need to cross the Volta river by ferry-canoe. Local life is very much centered around the river where local fishermen prepare their boats and nets, children play and swim, and women do their laundry.The village consists largely of termite clay houses with thatched roofs. <br><br>

The <a href="http://www.joli-ecotours.com/villagelodge-atsiekpoe.htm" target="_blank">Cashew Village Lodge</a>, built by Jolinaiko Eco Tours, is situated right on the riverbank, offering a great view and a welcoming breeze. The lodge consists of two mud-brick/termite clay buildings with thatched roofs offering five basic guestrooms. There is a simple bathhouse (bucket shower), self-composting toilet, local-style kitchen and a summer hut at the waterfront. During your stay at the Cashew Village Lodge, you can take part in various 'community experiences' which are organized by the villagers.

    <name>Elmina Castle</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr"><img src="http://www.joli-ecotours.com/googlemaps/images/elmina.jpg"><span>Elmina Castle</span>Elmina Castle was built by Portugal in 1482 as SÃ£o Jorge da Mina (St. George Castle). It is a beautiful place with a dubious past. In 1637 it was seized by the Dutch from the Portuguese. First established as a trade settlement, the castle later became one of the most important stops on the route of the Atlantic slave trade. The slave trade continued under the Dutch until 1814; in 1871 the Dutch Gold Coast, including the fort, became a possession of the British Empire. The castle is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.<br><br>You can visit the fort and its museum, climb St. Jago Hill and enjoy the view of colorful Elmina and its lagoon and fishing harbour. Also worth a visit is the Dutch Cemetery. You can combine your visit with the nearby Cape Coast Castle.</div><p>&copy; <a href="http://www.joli-ecotours.com" target="_blank">Jolinaiko Eco Tours</a>.

    <name>Cape Coast Castle</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr"><img src="http://www.joli-ecotours.com/googlemaps/images/capecoast.jpg"><span>Cape Coast Castle</span>The Cape Coast Castle was built for the slave-trade and is one of the most impressive of Ghana's old forts. It was originally built by the Dutch in 1637, later expanded by the Swedes, finally the British took control of it in 1664 and turned it into their colonial headquarters. It stayed that way for the next 200 years until they moved the capital to Accra in 1877.
<br><br>
The Cape Coast Castle is now an excellent museum with information about the history of Ghana, the slave-trade and local culture. Tours through the Castle will take you through the dungeons and the "door of no return".</div><p>&copy; <a href="http://www.joli-ecotours.com" target="_blank">Jolinaiko Eco Tours</a>.

    <name>Kakum National Park</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr"><img src="http://www.joli-ecotours.com/googlemaps/images/kakum.jpg"><span>The Canopy Walkway in Kakum</span>Half an hour drive from Cape Coast and Elmina, you find Kakum National Park. The 375 square km area is covered with tropical rainforest and contains many endangered animal species. 
<br><br>
Kakum National Park is famous for its long series of hanging bridges at the forest canopy level known as the "Canopy Walkway." At 40 meters height, the visitor can approach the plants and animals from a vantage point that would otherwise be inaccessible to people. The Canopy Walkway passes over 7 bridges and runs over a length of 330 meters. 
<br><br>
What about an overnight stay at the Kakum Tree House, a 30 meter high platform in the middle of the rain forest? Hearing the sounds of the forest, especially the birds and monkeys will certainly become a memorable experience.</div>

    <name>Daboya, Fugu cloth weaving</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr"><img src="http://www.joli-ecotours.com/googlemaps/images/daboya.jpg"><span>Weaving of Fugu</span>Daboya is the most famous of Ghana's Fugu weaving communities. Like Kente, Fugu fabric is hand woven, but the strips are narrower and have indigo and white stripes, rather than Kente's geometric patterns. Fugu is virtually the only economic activity in Daboya and nearly all of its residents are involved with its production. Residents are very welcoming and eager to share their heritage. <br><br>Tour the village with a guide to see all aspects of Fugu production â making dyes with local materials, dyeing cloth, creating designs, weaving strips, and sewing clothing. In the process, you'll see much of the village and feel its rhythms of daily life. </div><p>Â© <a href="http://www.joli-ecotours.com" target="_blank">Jolinaiko Eco Tours</a>.

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr"><img src="http://www.joli-ecotours.com/googlemaps/images/handinhand.jpg"><span>Guesthouses on the premises</span>Just out of Nkoranza, Dutch doctor Ineke Bosman realised her dream of creating a safe and loving place to live for mentally handicapped children, the <a href="http://www.operationhandinhand.nl/engels.htm" target="_blank">Hand in Hand Community</a>. These children are still often undervalued and abandoned, mostly as a result of the widely spread fear for "evil spirits". According to a difficult to eradicate superstition in Ghana, these spirits are the cause of the handicap of these children. Therefore their histories often are unbelievable sad, full of stories about rejection, neglect, abandonment and even maltreatment or worse.
<br><br>
You can stay at the premises of the community to help, play with the children at the pool, or just to relax and enjoy the special atmosphere. On the premises of the community, attractive overnight accommodation has been set up.</div><p>&copy; <a href="http://www.joli-ecotours.com" target="_blank">Jolinaiko Eco Tours</a>.

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr"><img src="http://www.joli-ecotours.com/googlemaps/images/ntonso.jpg"><span>Printing of Adinkra symbols</span>Another nice road stop is the Ashanti village Ntonso, 20 km northwest of Kumasi. Ntonso is the traditional production centre of Adinkra cloth. 
<br><br>
Adinkra are visual symbols, originally created by the Akan of Ghana and the Gyaman of Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa, that represent concepts or aphorisms. Adinkra symbols are printed on cloth, which is principally used for funeral purposes, although nowadays it is not uncommon to see people wearing it on a normal day. The dye used to print the symbols is made by mashing the bark of Bedia trees. The stamps are made from calabash wood in which the symbols are carved.
<br><br>
Ntonso has its own visitor's centre called the Ntonso Craft Village. Here they have a museum and you can stamp your own symbols. The museum guide can show you around the village.</div><p>&copy; <a href="http://www.joli-ecotours.com" target="_blank">Jolinaiko Eco Tours</a>. All rights reserved.</p>]]></description>

You can stay in homestays or in the <a href="http://www.greenhouseghana.com/" target="_blank">Green House guesthouse</a>, a combination of western comfort and Ghanaian tradition.

There's the hassle and bustle of traffic jams, people and music from rhythmic beats, items being sold everywhere, a dazzling diversity of scents and colors. It's amazing, overwhelming, cozy and some areas are extremely hectic. <br><br>There are touristic highlights, such as the Mausoleum, National Museum and Independence Square, some really interesting galleries, art centers and beaches.
